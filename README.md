# Task Management System

Implemented the logic to develop a task management system in Dart.

## Project Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, run the following command:
   
   git clone https://github.com/itshussainsprojects/Assignment1.git
   cd Assignment1

2. Ensure you have Dart installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the application using the `dart run` command.

## Architecture

The application is structured as follows:

1. `task.dart`: Defines the `Task` class with the required properties.
2. `task_manager.dart`: Implements the `TaskManager` class with methods for managing the task list.
3. `main.dart`: The entry point of the application, which handles the console-based user interface and interacts with the `TaskManager`.
4. `tasks.json`: The JSON file for storing and loading the task list.(To be implemented)

## Functionality

The application provides the following features:

- Add a new task
- Update an existing task
- Delete a task
- List all tasks
- List completed tasks
- List incomplete tasks
- Toggle the completion status of a task
- Exit the application
